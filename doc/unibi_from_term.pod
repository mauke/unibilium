=head1 NAME

unibi_from_term - read a terminfo entry for a named terminal

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <unibilium.h>
 
 unibi_term *unibi_from_term(const char *name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function locates the terminfo file for I<name>, then calls C<unibi_from_file>.
If it fails, it looks up I<name> in a small compiled-in terminfo database, calling
C<unibi_from_mem>.

It looks in the following places:

=over

=item 1.

If the environment variable C<TERMINFO> is set, it is interpreted as the name
of the directory to search. No other directory is used.

=item 2.

Otherwise, C<$HOME/.terminfo> is tried.

=item 3.

If that was not successful and C<TERMINFO_DIRS> is set, it is interpreted as a
colon-separated list of directories to search.

=item 4.

If C<TERMINFO_DIRS> is not set, a compiled-in fallback (C<unibi_terminfo_dirs>)
is used instead.

=back

The compiled-in terminfo database uses loose matching where anything following
a minus sign in I<name> is ignored, and the following names are matched:
C<xterm>,
C<screen>,
C<tmux>,
C<rxvt>,
C<putty>,
C<linux>,
C<interix>,
C<iterm>,
C<iTerm.app>,
C<st>,
C<vte>,
C<gnome>, and
C<ansi>.
